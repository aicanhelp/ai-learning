## ai-learning

- (1) Collect some famous opensource projects of AI: adding them as submodules of git into 'resources' folder
- (2) Try to refactor some projects or add some comments or do some experiments for learning them deeply: adding my codes in 'content' folder

#### Records:
- 2020-3: Refactoring and more comments on ELECTRA to make it more readable, on 'content/Easy-ELECTRA'
    **ELECTRA** is a new method for self-supervised language representation learning. 
    It can be used to pre-train transformer networks using relatively little compute. 
    ELECTRA models are trained to distinguish "real" input tokens vs "fake" input tokens generated by another neural network, 
    similar to the discriminator of a [GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf). 
    At small scale, ELECTRA achieves strong results even when trained on a single GPU. 
    At large scale, ELECTRA achieves state-of-the-art results on the [SQuAD 2.0](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) dataset.
    For a detailed description and experimental results, please refer to our paper 
    [ELECTRA: Pre-training Text Encoders as Discriminators Rather Than Generators](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1xMH1BtvB).
